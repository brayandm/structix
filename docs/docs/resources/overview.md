# Overview

The **Resources** section of Structix CLI documentation provides a structured view of all manageable entities within your backend and DevOps environments.

Instead of grouping commands by actions, this section organizes them by **resource type**, such as clusters, microservices, or ingress controllers, making it easier to:

-   Understand what operations are available for each specific resource.
-   Discover all commands applicable to a given resource at a glance.
-   Navigate the CLI from a resource-oriented perspective.

This resource-centric approach helps you:

-   Focus on the entities you're managing (e.g., `cluster`, `microservice`, `db`).
-   Identify all lifecycle operations available for each one (`create`, `destroy`, `deploy`, etc.).
-   Gain a clearer picture of Structix’s capabilities from an infrastructure and domain perspective.

> 💡 Tip: Use this section if you prefer thinking in terms of “what” you’re managing (e.g., a cluster or service), rather than “how” you’re acting on it.
