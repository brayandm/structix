Documentation for `structix proj add microservice` command.

Scaffold a new microservice within a project that follows a Microservices architecture.

## Usage

structix proj add microservice <name>
```

## Options

This command currently has no options.

## Examples

To create a new microservice named `user-service`, you would run:

```bash
structix proj add microservice user-service
